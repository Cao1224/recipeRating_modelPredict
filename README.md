## Problem Identification



## Baseline Model

**Features:**
- calories
  - Calorie content affects the protein content of a recipe, since high-calorie foods are often high protein. For example, meat🥩 annd dairy🧀🫘 products are high in calories and protein. However, it should be noted that not all high-calorie foods are high-protein, and not all high-protein foods are high-calorie. Some 🫘plant-based proteins are also high!
- total fat (PDV)
  - Protein content in a recipe can be impacted by fat content because fat can mute the protein in a dish. For example, a recipe that is high in fat but low in protein will have a lower protein-to-fat ratio than a recipe that is high in protein but low in fat. The protein flavor of a dish can also be masked by fat, making it less prominent as fat can provide a more satisfying overall flavor experience.
- carbohydrates (PDV)
Note: PDV stands for “percentage of daily value”


## Final Model

Since plant-based protein may have a different nutrient profile compared to animal-based protein, this can affect the amount of protein in a recipe. I decided to add tags about plant-based protein and animal-based protein as features.

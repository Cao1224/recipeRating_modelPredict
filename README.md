## Problem Identification



## Baseline Model

The baselind model is a linear regression model with degree of 3 polynomial features, I chose 3 featuress related to protein content.
- `calories`
  - Calorie content affects the protein content of a recipe, since high-calorie foods are often high protein. For example, meatü•© annd dairyüßÄ products are high in calories and protein. However, it should be noted that not all high-calorie foods are high-protein, and not all high-protein foods are high-calorie. Some ü´òplant-based proteins are also high!
- `total fat` (PDV)
  - Protein content in a recipe can be impacted by fat content because fat can mute the protein in a dish. For example, a recipe that is high in fat but low in protein will have a lower protein-to-fat ratio than a recipe that is high in protein but low in fat. The protein flavor of a dish can also be masked by fat, making it less prominent as fat can provide a more satisfying overall flavor experience.
- `carbohydrates` (PDV)
  - Carbohydrates can also affect protein content by affecting the overall nutritional content of a recipe. For example, recipes high in carbohydrates may be low in other nutrients like protein or fats, which can affect the overall protein content of the meal.
  
Note: PDV stands for ‚Äúpercentage of daily value‚Äù

At first, polynomial regression was used with polynomial features of degree 1 - 15, and the training and testing errors were visualized to observe any trends (refer to Figure 1 below). It was found that the training and test errors for polynomials 1-4 were almost identical, making it difficult to choose which polynomial should be used for protein prediction and model evaluation.

Hence, k-fold cross-validation was used to find the best fit polynomial. The 5-fold cross-validation results showed that a degree of 1 was the best fit because it has the lowest average RMSE across all the folds of cross-validation. Additionally, the degree of polynomial features used in each fold was recorded, with the first and third folds using a degree of 1, and the second, fourth, and fifth folds using a degree of 2. This indicates that a second-degree polynomial may provide a better fit for the data in certain cases.



## Final Model

Since plant-based protein may have a different nutrient profile compared to animal-based protein, this can affect the amount of protein in a recipe. I decided to add tags about plant-based protein and animal-based protein as features.
